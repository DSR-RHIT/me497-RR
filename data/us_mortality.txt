Caveats:
"1. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the live births for the"
"given time period. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"4. Population figures in this table for 1979 and 1981-89 are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population of the"
"United States. Note that the state and county population estimates for these years are not consistent with national estimates."
"The population figures in this table for 1980 and 1990 are modified age-race-sex (MARS) April 1 census counts. The population"
"figures for 1991-98 are bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population."
"5. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
