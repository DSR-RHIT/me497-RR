# centering figures and captions 

R Markdown does not have a feature for centering figures, but we can use the Word styles-reference document for a work-around for docx output. 

## use heading 6

In much the same way we used *Heading 5* to create a page break, we can use *Heading 6* to center things in a docx output document. 


Getting started 

- Open an Rmd script  
- At the location where you wish to insert a centered image, type the 6 hashtags that indicate a level-6 heading, and repeat on the next line. 
- Add some temporary text, for example, 

```
    ###### the figure will go here 
    ###### the caption will go here
```

- Save and Knit 

Edit the *Heading 6* Style 

- In the Word doc that appears, select the lines formatted with the Heading 6 style  
- Modify the style to be centered on the page 
- Modify the typeface as desired for figure captions 

Save the file as your latest `word-styles-reference-nn.docx` replacing `nn` with your next version number. 

- Close the docx file 


## the markup

In the Rmd script, replace the two temporary lines: 

- heading-6, line 1, import the image 
- heading-6, line 2, the figure caption 

```
    ###### ![](my-image.png) 
    ###### Figure 1: Caption for my image 
```

- Save and Knit. 

For subsequent centered images, use the heading-6 markup again, e.g.,  

```
    ###### ![](my-next-image.png) 
    ###### Figure 2: Caption for my next image 
```
