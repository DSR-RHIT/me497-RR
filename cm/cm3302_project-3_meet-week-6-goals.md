## assignment

  - Meet with your advisor and to review your proposal and my comments,
    questions, and concerns.
  - Revise the proposal accordingly as soon as possible and continue the
    work.
  - In the report, the analysis has to be transparent and explained,
    that is, you explain the analysis with visible code chunks and
    outputâ€”unlike articles in which the analysis is discussed but not
    explicitly shown.

*By the end of week 3*

The report-in-progress shows that **raw data** have been acquired though
not necessarily in tidy form.

*By the end of week 4*

The report-in-progress shows the computational work that operates on the
raw data to produce a **tidy data** set to be used in further analysis.

*By the end of week 5*

The report-in-progress adds the **analysis** that operates on the tidy
data to produce **results**

*By the end of week 6*
