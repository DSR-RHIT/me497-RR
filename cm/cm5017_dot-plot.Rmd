# dot plot  

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, collapse = TRUE)
```


The *dot plot* by Bill Cleveland is a preferred substitute for data typically shown in pie charts or bar charts. If you would like to read more about the rationale behind dot plots, see [@robbins2013].  

The data structure for which dot plots are suited are:  

- Observations include one categorical variable and one quantitative variable.  
- The same where the categories are *conditioned* by additional categories. 
- In any case, there is just one numerical quantity displayed, usually along the horizontal $x$ axis. 

## data 

Create `dot_plot.Rmd` in your `practice_work/` directory. Write the code chunks in the tutorial with as much of the prose as you like  to explain the work. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The standard R installation includes US "state" data sets, with all data arranged according to alphabetical order of the state names. (Learn more by typing `?state`  in your Console.) There are 7 data sets, named:  

```
state.abb 
state.area 
state.center 
state.division 
state.name 
state.region 
state.x77 
````
Let's take a look at several variables, one numerical (area) and three that are categorical (abbreviation, name, and region): 

```{r}
# examine the vector of abbreviations
glimpse(state.abb)

# examine the vector of names  
glimpse(state.name)

# examine the vector of areas  
glimpse(state.area)

# examine the vector of regions 
glimpse(state.region)
```

Of the categorical variables, two are encoded as characters (abbreviation and state) and one is encoded as a factor (region). 

Let's collect these 4 vectors in a new data frame, renaming the variables to eliminate the "dot" in the variable names and writing the data to file for later use. 

```{r}
# create a new data frame
state_df <- data_frame(abbr = state.abb, 
		name   = state.name, 
		area   = state.area, 
		region = state.region)
```

Examine the result

```{r}
glimpse(state_df)
```

```{r}
# write the df to file for later use 
write_csv(state_df, "data/cm5017_state.csv")
```

Recall the data structure. Note that the factor variable (region) has been changed to a character variable. 

```{r}
# recall the contents
glimpse(state_df)
```

Examine the area data more closely. 


```{r}
summary(state_df$area)
```

With area values in the hundreds of thousands of square miles, the graph scale is easier to read if we display in thousands of square miles.

```{r}
# create a new column with area in 1000s of sq mi
state_df <- state_df %>%
	mutate(scaled_area = area / 1000)
```

I'm going to assign region as an ordered factor (for graph conditioning), arranged by descending order of the median area in each region. In a column of conditioned ggplot2 graphs, the top panel is determined by the factor level-1, the second panel is level-2, etc. 

```{r}
# region as an ordered factor 
state_df$region <- factor(state_df$region, 
	levels = c("West", "North Central", "South", "Northeast"),
	ordered = TRUE)

# check the result
typeof(state_df$region)

# ordered levels
levels(state_df$region)
```

The West region has a collection of states with the largest median area; the Northeast has the smallest median state area. 

## graph 

The basic dot plot is obtained using the `geom_point()` function. Structurally, this is an x-y scatterplot with the quantitative variable on the x-axis and the qualitative variable on the y-axis. 

 
```{r}
fig <- ggplot(state_df, aes(x = scaled_area, y = name)) +
  geom_point()

fig
```

To easily make visual comparisons, we'd like the rows of the dot plot ordered in descending values of the areas. The `reorder(name, scaled_area)`  argument can be read, "Reorder the rows (names of the states) from top to bottom in order of descending scaled area (the x variable)."

Edit the previous code. 
```{r}
fig <- ggplot(state_df, aes(x = scaled_area, y = reorder(name, scaled_area))) +
  geom_point()

fig
```

Next, I'll add some formatting layers to 

- Set the x-scale limits and tick mark locations 
- Set the x label and omit the y label 
- Assign a title 
- Use the black and white theme 
- Omit the x-grid 
- Include the y-grid as gray lines 
- Adjust the title font size and location 
- Omit the y tick marks 


```{r}
fig <- fig +  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 600, 100), limits = c(0, 600)) +
  labs(x = "Area (thousand square miles)", y = NULL) +
  ggtitle("Fig. 4.3 State areas ordered by size") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "grey70"), 
    plot.title   = element_text(size = rel(1), vjust = 1.5),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
    )

fig
```

The graph is a bit compressed vertically, so I'll print to file to control the resolution and dimensions, then read the PNG file back in to the document. I usually do a bit of sizing trial and error before I get an output I like. 


```{r results='hide'}
# print to file
ggsave("results/cm05017_dot-plot.png", plot = fig, 
    width = 6.5, height = 7.5, units = "in", dpi = 100)
```

```{r}
# read the PNG file back in to the document
knitr::include_graphics("../results/cm05017_dot-plot.png")
```


<!-- ## conditioning  -->

<!-- *Conditioning* converts a single dot plot into multiple panels, where each panel is a plot with the same scales, but the data belong to a particular subset of the data.  -->

<!-- The subsets are determined by the levels of the factor used for conditioning.  -->

<!-- In this example, the conditioning variable is `region`, with 4 levels. Thus the conditioned plot has four subpanels, one each for "West", "North Central", "South", and  "Northeast".  -->

<!-- Conditioning in ggplot2 is accomplished using `facet_grid()`.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fig <- fig +  -->
<!-- 	facet_grid(region ~ .)  -->

<!-- fig -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Ouch, that's ugly.  -->

<!-- A typical data set will have an entry for every intersection of the two categorical variables, but here a state name can only belong to one region.  -->

<!-- To eliminate the names that don't exist in a region, we use the `scales = "free_y"` argument.    -->

<!-- Add to the existing code.  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fig <- fig +  -->
<!-- 	facet_grid(region ~ ., scales = "free_y") -->

<!-- fig -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The default is for the panels to have the same vertical height. But the number of states in a region is not constant, hence the panels all have different numbers of rows.  -->

<!-- To allow the panel heights to self-adjust for equal row spacing, we add the `space = "free"` argument.  -->

<!-- Add to the existing code and write to file.   -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fig <- fig +  -->
<!-- 	facet_grid(region ~ ., scales = "free_y", space = "free") +  -->
<!-- 	  ggtitle("Fig. 4.3 State areas ordered by region and size")  -->

<!-- ggsave("results/cm05017_dot-plot-conditioned.png", plot = fig,  -->
<!--     width = 6.5, height = 7.5, units = "in", dpi = 100) -->

<!-- # read the PNG file back in to the document -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("../results/cm05017_dot-plot-conditioned.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Pretty neat!  -->
