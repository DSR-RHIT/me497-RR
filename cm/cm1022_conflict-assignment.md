# managing version control changes and conflicts

In class, using Project 1

  - In the YAML header, change your name
  - Save
  - Commit but do not push or pull
  - As your collaborator, I will do the same and push to the repo

Once I’ve done that, I’ll let you know. We have created a condition in
which both of us have edited the same line of the file.

  - Pull your repo
  - You should get a conflict message
  - Follow the instructions discussed earleir to resolve the conflict
  - When complete, push to the repo
