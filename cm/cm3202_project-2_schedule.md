In the report, the analysis has to be transparent and explained, that

articles in which the analysis is discussed but not explicitly shown.

*By the end of week 6*

The report-in-progress shows that raw data have been acquired though not
necessarily in tidy form.

*By the end of week 7*

The report-in-progress shows the computational work that operates on the

*By the end of week 8*

The report-in-progress adds the analysis that operates on the tidy data
to produce results

*The remaining weeks*

Refine the data acquisition, data tidying, analysis, and final results
