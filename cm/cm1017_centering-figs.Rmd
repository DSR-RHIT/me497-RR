# centering figures and captions

R Markdown does not have a feature for centering, but we can use the Word styles-reference document for a work-around for docx output. 




## assignment

- Update your `word-styles-reference-nn.docx` document to include the centering Heading 6  
- Save the file and increment its number to $nn + 1$ 
- In your project 1 Rmd report, import an image, center it, and add a caption 
- Knit the document to docx 
- Check the output, confirm that the figure and caption are correctly formatted
