# graph tour overview

There are currently four graphical systems available in R:

  - `base` graphics, by Ross Ihaka, is included in every R installation
  - `grid` graphics, by Paul Murrell, provides low-level access to
    graphic primitives
  - `lattice`, by Deepayan Sarkar, excels at displaying multivariate
    data
  - `ggplot2`, by Hadley Wickham, is based on a comprehensive graphical
    “grammar”

I’ve used `lattice` for years now, but all the cool kids at the R
conference are using `ggplot2` (and its part of the tidyverse).

As you work through the tour, create a new script for each graph type in
your `practice_work/` directory.

  - Cleveland dot plot
  - multiway plot
  - histogram
  - box and whisker plot
  - scatter plot
  - time series
