## hyphens and dashes

Adapted from *The Punctuation Guide* (Penn, 2018).

1.  `-` hyphen for compound words such as “advanced-level” or
    “first-year” or for numbers that are not inclusive such as phone
    numbers 1-812-555-8900.
2.  `--` n-dash (the width of the letter N) means “through”, e.g., July
    9–August 17 or pages 37–59. These values designate an inclusive
    span.
3.  `---`m-dash (the width of the letter M) is a punctuation mark that
    can be used to replace commas, parentheses, or a colon, but the
    em-dash is more emphatic. Examples of the em-dash include,

> And yet, when the car was finally delivered—nearly three months after
> it was ordered—she decided she no longer wanted it, leaving the dealer
> with an oddly equipped car that would be difficult to sell.

> Upon discovering the errors—all 124 of them—the publisher immediately
> recalled the books.

> The white sand, the warm water, the sparkling sun—this is what brought
> them to Hawaii.
