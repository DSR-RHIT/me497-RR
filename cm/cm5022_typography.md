Useful things to know about punctuation, headings, typography, and so
forth.

## hyphens and dashes

Adapted from *The Punctuation Guide* (Penn, [2018](#ref-penn2018)).

1.  `-` hyphen for compound words such as “advanced-level” or
    “first-year” or for numbers that are not inclusive such as phone
    numbers 1-812-555-8900.
2.  `--` n-dash (the width of the letter N) means “through”, e.g., July
    9–August 17 or pages 37–59. These values designate an inclusive
    span.
3.  `---`m-dash (the width of the letter M) is a punctuation mark that
    can be used to replace commas, parentheses, or a colon, but the
    em-dash is more emphatic. Examples of the em-dash include,

> And yet, when the car was finally delivered—nearly three months after
> it was ordered—she decided she no longer wanted it, leaving the dealer
> with an oddly equipped car that would be difficult to sell.

> Upon discovering the errors—all 124 of them—the publisher immediately
> recalled the books.

> The white sand, the warm water, the sparkling sun—this is what brought
> them to Hawaii.

## headings

This section based on the recommendations posted by Baker
([2001](#ref-baker2001)) and Tufte ([2018](#ref-tufte2018)).

  - Other than the title, plan on having two levels of headings only
  - Accent text can be a third level if needed.

## typography

  - Headings and subheadings can be a sans-serif typeface  
  - But the main body of text should be a serif typeface

## spacing
