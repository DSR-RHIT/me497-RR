# references and citations 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

We will use the bib format (from BiBTeX) for bibliographies. The  basic steps are: 

- Create the bib file  
- Specify the bib file in the YAML header of the Rmd script
- Add the citation to the report  
- Add a references heading 




## create the bib file

To create the bib file:

- Open a new text file in RStudio, *File &gt; New File &gt; Text File*
- *Save As* `project_name.bib` in the `resources` directory





## create reference entries in the bib file

You will type references into the `.bib` file something like this, where 

- `@manual` denotes a specific document type, e.g., article, book, etc. 
- `ansi-isa-1995` is a reference label you assign here to be used later in the citation 
- Each reference type has a few required arguments and other arguments are  optional


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
include_graphics("../resources/images/bib-details.png")
```

<!-- <pre class="r"><code>@manual{ansi-isa-1995, -->
<!--     title        = {Process instrumentation terminology}, -->
<!--     edition      = {ANSI/ISA-S51.1-1979, reaffirmed 1995}, -->
<!--     organization = {Instrument Society of America}, -->
<!--     address      = {Research Triangle Park, NC}, -->
<!--     year         = {1995}, -->
<!--     note         = {ISBN 0-87664-390-4}, -->
<!-- }</code></pre> -->


For help in formatting the entries in the bib file by article type, e.g., article, proceedings, book, manual, etc., try the  [verbosus](https://verbosus.com/bibtex-style-examples.html) site.




## forcing capitalization when needed

References are sometimes not capitalized the way you expect. Return to the `.bib` file and place braces `{}` around letters you want capitalized.

For example,

```
@book{gandrud2015,
  author    = {Christopher Gandrud},
  title     = {Reproducible {R}esearch with {R} and {RS}tudio},
  publisher = {CRC Press},
  year      = {2015},
  address   = {Boca Raton, FL},
  edition   = {2},
}
```



## specify the bib file in the YAML header

Add the bibliography argument to the front matter including the relative path if needed.

<pre class="r"><code>---
title: "Load-cell calibration report"
author: "name"
date: "date"
output: word_document
bibliography: "../resources/project_name.bib"
---</code></pre>





## add the citation to the report

- Citation syntax has the form `[@ref_label]` 
- `ref_label` is the reference label you assigned in the bib file


In the report Rmd file, add the citation at the appropriate location in the paragraph, for example,

    The test procedure follows the ANSI/ISA standard [@ansi-isa-1995].

When you knit the document, the citation is automatically formatted.

> The test procedure follows the ANSI/ISA standard (*Process Instrumentation Terminology* 1995).







## add a references heading

At the end of the Rmd script, add a references section heading.

<pre class="r"><code># References
</code></pre>

All references cited in your report will be automatically formatted and listed here, at the end of the report, for example, 

> *References*
>
> *Process Instrumentation Terminology*. 1995. ANSI/ISA-S51.1-1979,
reaffirmed 1995. Research Triangle Park, NC: Instrument Society of America.


## example 

For example, suppose this entry for our course text is in the bib file, 

    @book{wickhamgrolemund2016,
        author    	= {Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund},
        title     	= {R for Data Science},
        year      	= {2016},
        publisher 	= {O'Reilly Media, Inc.},
        address     = {Sebastopol, CA}
    }

And in the document we write this sentnce to cite the book, 

    Our course text describes the importance of learning the 
    tools of data science [@wickhamgrolemund2016]. 

The knitted output looks like this, 

> Our course text describes the importance of learning the tools of data science [@wickhamgrolemund2016]. 

And the reference itself is shown at the end of this page. 



## changing the format

Citations and references are both formatted automatically. To change the format, we use a CSL file. You don't have to create one. Just find the one that meets your needs online and download it. 

- Find a [CSL style file](https://citationstyles.org/authors/) that suits your needs, for example `chicago-author-date.csl` or `ieee.csl`
- Download the CSL file and save it in your `resources/` folder
- Edit the YAML header to designate the CSL style file you wish to use.

<pre class="r"><code>---
title: "Load-cell calibration report"
author: "name"
date: "date"
output: word_document
bibliography: "../resources/project_name.bib"
csl: "../resources/chicago-author-date.csl"
---</code></pre>
