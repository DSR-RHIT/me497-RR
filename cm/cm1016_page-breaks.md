# page breaks

R Markdown does not have a feature for page breaks, but we can use the
Word styles-reference document for a work-around for docx output.

## assignment

  - Update your `word-styles-reference-nn.docx` document to include the
    page break Heading 5
  - Save the file and increment its number to \(nn + 1\)
  - In your project 1 Rmd report, add a page break in the middle of any
    page for practice
  - Knit the document to docx
  - Check the output, confirm that the page break ocurred at the
    location you expected
  - Comment-out the heading

I prefer to comment-out the heading so that later if I need it I donâ€™t
have to remember what level heading I used for the page break. I just
find it, copy and paste it where needed, and uncomment it.
